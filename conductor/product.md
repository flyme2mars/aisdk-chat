- **Developers:** Specifically those looking to learn, implement, or evaluate the Vercel AI SDK for their own projects.

## Key SDK Demonstration Features
- **Real-time Streaming:** Seamless implementation of streaming responses to provide an interactive user experience.
- **Multi-turn Conversations:** Management of chat history and context throughout a session.
- **Provider Agnostic Architecture:** Demonstrating how to easily switch between model providers (using OpenRouter as the initial example).
- **Advanced SDK Capabilities:** Showcasing complex workflows like **Tool Calling (Functions)** and **Object Generation** for structured data.

## UI/UX & Resilience
- **Polished Interface:** Including refinements like smooth auto-scrolling, clear typing indicators, and distinct avatars for users and the AI.
