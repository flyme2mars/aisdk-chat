# Product Guidelines: AI SDK Chat Demonstration

## Prose Style & Tone
- **Minimalist:** All prose (documentation, system messages, placeholders) will be brief and direct. The focus should be on the technical implementation and UI mechanics rather than conversational depth.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern Dark Mode:** A sleek, developer-centric aesthetic using deep grays, high-contrast text, and a "terminal-inspired" but modern feel.

## Brand Messaging
- **Subtle Branding:** The "brand" of the app should be secondary to its function. The application should feel like a clean slate that showcases the Vercel AI SDK without competing for attention.

## Accessibility & Inclusion
- **Keyboard-only Navigation:** The application must be fully functional using only a keyboard, ensuring high usability for developers and power users.
